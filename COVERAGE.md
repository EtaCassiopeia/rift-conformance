# Coverage & parity checkpoints

This file is the audit trail for the shell-suite → two-plane-harness migration (DESIGN §11).

## The parity-checkpoint rule

A shell leg is **deleted only after** its Plane A replacement has run **green on the same engine
build, in the same session**, with the port-audit row filled in. Each checkpoint below records the
build SHA and both gates' results on that SHA. No shell script is removed in the checkpoint issue
itself — retirement happens in a later, dedicated issue (e.g. #8, #11) that cites the checkpoint.

## Plane A checkpoints

| # | Date | Engine build (master) | Shell gate | Plane A gate | Verdict |
|---|------|-----------------------|------------|--------------|---------|
| 0 | 2026-07-03 | `4bc567dd06691a8c980b67d67994b696cc8f81d5` (built 2026-07-03T15:40:15Z) | `consistency-gate.sh` → **15 AGREE, 0 DISAGREE** (exit 0) | `sbt engineGate` (feature 01) → **5/5 scenarios PASSED** | ✅ **PARITY** |

### Checkpoint 0 — consistency gate (`consistency-gate.sh` ↔ `features/rift/01-consistency-gate`)

Same clean-master build (`build-rift.sh`, commit `4bc567d`) fed to both gates in one session:

- **Old shell gate** — `RIFT=$RIFT_BUILD_DIR/rift-http-proxy RIFT_LINT=… RIFT_VERIFY=…
  ~/Projects/rift-imposter-samples/scripts/consistency-gate.sh`: every corpus config AGREES across
  engine + `rift-lint` + `rift-verify` — **15/15 AGREE, 0 DISAGREE**, "all configs agree across
  engine + rift-lint + rift-verify".
- **New Plane A gate** — `RIFT_MODE=external RIFT_BUILD_DIR=… RIFT_CORPUS_ROOT=… sbt engineGate`:
  all five scenarios green — @preflight version coherence (live `--version` == BUILD_INFO),
  corpus present (≥15 files), `rift-lint` 0 errors, engine serves every corpus imposter on its
  declared port, `rift-verify` 0 failures.

Both gates assert the same property (engine ↔ lint ↔ verify agreement over the corpus) and reach the
same verdict on the same SHA. The Plane A gate additionally proves version coherence and names
offending files on failure (its RED path is verified: a corrupted corpus file turns it red naming
that file).

#### Port audit

| Range | Owner | This checkpoint |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 45xx  | Corpus imposters (posted verbatim, byte-fidelity) | 4501–4520 (15 files) |
| 46xx  | Plane B mock corpus | not used here (Plane B lands in #13) |
| 48xx  | Plane A in-harness probes (fresh-imposter pool) | not used by the gate feature (corpus-only) |
| 2525  | Admin API (harness external mode) | Plane A engine; shell gate ran its own engine on a separate admin port |

#### Retirement status

`consistency-gate.sh` is **NOT deleted** here — this checkpoint only establishes parity. Its
retirement (with `conformance-reload.sh`) is **#11**, which will cite this row.

## Plane A behavioral port audit (§5 · 1:1 shell-assert → scenario)

The behavioral core of the shell suite (`conformance.sh`, `conformance-ext.sh`) is ported one
assertion at a time. Each row: shell assert → Plane A scenario. This section fills in as features
02–06 land (issue #7).

### `02-core-serving.feature` ← conformance.sh + conformance-ext.sh (core) — DONE

| Shell assert | Plane A scenario | Fixture |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| `not`+`startsWith` path predicate | `predicate not+startsWith selects the stub` (Outline) | `core/predicates` |
| `matches` regex path predicate | `predicate matches selects the stub` (Outline) | `core/predicates` |
| `jsonpath` body-selector predicate | `predicate jsonpath selects the stub` (Outline) | `core/predicates` |
| `xpath` body-selector predicate | `predicate xpath selects the stub` (Outline) | `core/predicates` |
| `repeat:N` response cycling + wrap-around | `response cycling with repeat:N wraps around` | `core/cycling` |
| `copy` path regex group into body | `copy path regex group into the response body` | `core/copy-path` |
| FSM two-step state transition | `FSM two-step state transition` | `core/fsm` |
| multi-value `Set-Cookie` preserved | `multi-value Set-Cookie headers are preserved` | `core/cookies` |
| date template (`{{DAYS+N}}`) renders | `date template renders to an ISO-8601 date` | `core/date-template` |
| `defaultForward` proxies unmatched | `defaultForward proxies unmatched requests to another imposter` | `core/forward-target`, `core/forwarder` |
| single-port gateway `/__rift/:port/…` | `single-port gateway routes to an imposter by port` | `core/gateway` |

Remaining behavioral features (this issue's scope, still open): `03-faults-transport`,
`04-scripting-bounds`, `05-templating`, `06-behaviors`. #7 closes when 06 lands.
