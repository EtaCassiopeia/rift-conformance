# Coverage & parity checkpoints

This file is the audit trail for the shell-suite → two-plane-harness migration (DESIGN §11).

## The parity-checkpoint rule

A shell leg is **deleted only after** its Plane A replacement has run **green on the same engine
build, in the same session**, with the port-audit row filled in. Each checkpoint below records the
build SHA and both gates' results on that SHA. No shell script is removed in the checkpoint issue
itself — retirement happens in a later, dedicated issue (e.g. #8, #11) that cites the checkpoint.

## Plane A checkpoints

| # | Date | Engine build (master) | Shell gate | Plane A gate | Verdict |
|---|------|-----------------------|------------|--------------|---------|
| 0 | 2026-07-03 | `4bc567dd06691a8c980b67d67994b696cc8f81d5` (built 2026-07-03T15:40:15Z) | `consistency-gate.sh` → **15 AGREE, 0 DISAGREE** (exit 0) | `sbt engineGate` (feature 01) → **5/5 scenarios PASSED** | ✅ **PARITY** |

### Checkpoint 0 — consistency gate (`consistency-gate.sh` ↔ `features/rift/01-consistency-gate`)

Same clean-master build (`build-rift.sh`, commit `4bc567d`) fed to both gates in one session:

- **Old shell gate** — `RIFT=$RIFT_BUILD_DIR/rift-http-proxy RIFT_LINT=… RIFT_VERIFY=…
  ~/Projects/rift-imposter-samples/scripts/consistency-gate.sh`: every corpus config AGREES across
  engine + `rift-lint` + `rift-verify` — **15/15 AGREE, 0 DISAGREE**, "all configs agree across
  engine + rift-lint + rift-verify".
- **New Plane A gate** — `RIFT_MODE=external RIFT_BUILD_DIR=… RIFT_CORPUS_ROOT=… sbt engineGate`:
  all five scenarios green — @preflight version coherence (live `--version` == BUILD_INFO),
  corpus present (≥15 files), `rift-lint` 0 errors, engine serves every corpus imposter on its
  declared port, `rift-verify` 0 failures.

Both gates assert the same property (engine ↔ lint ↔ verify agreement over the corpus) and reach the
same verdict on the same SHA. The Plane A gate additionally proves version coherence and names
offending files on failure (its RED path is verified: a corrupted corpus file turns it red naming
that file).

#### Port audit

| Range | Owner | This checkpoint |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 45xx  | Corpus imposters (posted verbatim, byte-fidelity) | 4501–4520 (15 files) |
| 46xx  | Plane B mock corpus | not used here (Plane B lands in #13) |
| 48xx  | Plane A in-harness probes (fresh-imposter pool) | not used by the gate feature (corpus-only) |
| 2525  | Admin API (harness external mode) | Plane A engine; shell gate ran its own engine on a separate admin port |

#### Retirement status

`consistency-gate.sh` is **NOT deleted** here — this checkpoint only establishes parity. Its
retirement (with `conformance-reload.sh`) is **#11**, which will cite this row.
